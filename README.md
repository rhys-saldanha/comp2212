# MachineLang
This repo is the result of a pair coursework (Nick's github [here][nick-link]) for COMP2212 at University of Southampton.

The task was to create a domain-specific language. The problems given were all maths based, specifically operations with (mathematical) languages, such as union, prefix and Kleene-star.
